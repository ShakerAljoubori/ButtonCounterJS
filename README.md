1. This project aims to practice my counter logic in JS.
2. First, create a counter variable and make it 0
3. Then target the button and add the .onclick propery. Equal to a function (that does etc)
4. Within the function, add counter++. This will be added by 1. Important to add this first so the computer will count the button press as 1 first in memory.
5. Then add the message + counter to display the count
7 (Bonus). There's a hidden message in the console log just for extra. (It's my name).
